# Sorting-Algorithm-DSA-

# Introduction
While SQL is primarily known for its data querying capabilities, it can also be used to implement and solve complex algorithms. This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to solve computational problems, such as sorting, searching, graph traversal, recursive algorithms, and more. It showcases practical examples of how algorithms, which are commonly implemented in programming languages like Python, C++, or Java, can also be effectively executed within the constraints of SQL.

Through this project, you'll learn how SQL can be used to tackle algorithmic challenges and how to optimize queries for efficiency and performance, especially when handling large datasets.

# Algorithms Covered
The Algorithms-SQL project covers a wide range of algorithms, implemented entirely using SQL:

# Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort,
Insertion Sort,
Quick Sort,
Merge Sort,
Heap Sort,
# Searching Algorithms:
Binary Search,
Linear Search,
Index-based Search,
# Graph Algorithms:
Breadth-First Search (BFS),
Depth-First Search (DFS),
Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm),
# Recursive Algorithms:
Fibonacci Series,
Factorial Computation,
Recursive Tree Traversals,
# Mathematical Algorithms:
Prime Number Identification,
Greatest Common Divisor (GCD),
Least Common Multiple (LCM),
Each algorithm is implemented using SQL queries, and results are stored and evaluated based on the dataset size, query execution time, and memory usage.

# SQL Optimization Techniques
Since SQL is not typically designed for algorithmic processing, performance optimization is crucial. This project covers various optimization techniques:

Indexing: How creating indexes can improve the speed of searching algorithms.
Query Caching: Using caching to store results of repeated queries.
Partitioning: Dividing large datasets into smaller, manageable partitions for faster processing.
Materialized Views: Precomputing and storing query results for frequently accessed data.
Joins and Subqueries: Efficiently managing joins and subqueries to minimize execution time.

# Data Structures
In this project, SQL is used to simulate common data structures such as:

Arrays: Handled using tables and arrays in SQL-supported databases.
Linked Lists: Simulated using recursive queries and foreign key relationships.
Graphs: Represented through adjacency matrices and adjacency lists using SQL tables.
Heaps: Implemented through the use of tree-based structures in SQL.
Each algorithm utilizes these data structures in a way that is native to SQL, showcasing how to manipulate and traverse data efficiently.

# Performance Analysis
Each algorithm's performance is analyzed based on:

Execution Time: How long the query takes to run, measured in milliseconds or seconds.
Memory Usage: How much memory is consumed during query execution.
Complexity: Analyzing the time complexity (e.g., O(n), O(log n)) of SQL queries.
Scalability: How well the algorithm scales with increasing dataset sizes.
Results of these analyses are stored in the results/ folder.
